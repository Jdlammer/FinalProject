Superman,8.3,Static,"To begin, lie straight and face down on the floor or exercise mat. Your arms should be fully extended in front of you. This is the starting position.
Simultaneously raise your arms, legs, and chest off of the floor and hold this contraction for 2 seconds. Tip: Squeeze your lower back to get the best results from this exercise. Remember to exhale during this movement. Note: When holding the contracted position, you should look like superman when he is flying.
Slowly begin to lower your arms, legs and chest back down to the starting position while inhaling.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions prescribed in your program."
Rhomboids-SMR,5.7,Static,"Lay down with your back on the floor. Place a foam roll underneath your upper back, and cross your arms in front of you, protracting your shoulders. This will be your starting position.
Raise your hips off of the ground, placing your weight onto the foam roll. Shift your weight to one side at a time, rolling over your middle and upper back. Pause at points of tension for 10-30 seconds."
Dancer's Stretch,5.4,Static,"Sit up on the floor.
Cross your right leg over your left, keeping the knee bent. Your left leg is straight and down on the floor.
Place your left arm on your right leg and your right hand on the floor.
Rotate your upper body to the right, and hold for 10-20 seconds. Switch sides."
Hug a Ball,5.4,Static,"Seat yourself on the floor.
Straddle an exercise ball between both legs and lower your hips down toward the floor.
Hug your arms around the ball to support your body. Adjust your legs so that your feet are flat on the floor and your knees line up over your ankles. Keep a good grip on the ball so it doesn't roll away from you and send you back onto your buttocks."
Cat Strecth,5.0,Static,"Position yourself on the floor on your hands and knees.
Pull your belly in and round your spine, lower back, shoulders, and neck, letting your head drop.
Hold for 15 seconds."
Hug Knees to Chest,4.4,Static,"Lie down on your back and pull both knees up to your chest.
Hold your arms under the knees, not over (that would put to much pressure on your knee joints).
Slowly pull the knees toward your shoulders. This also stretches your buttocks muscles."
Upper Back Stretch,4.2,Static,"Clasp fingers together with your thumbs pointing down, round your shoulders as you reach your hands forward."
Middle Back Stretch,3.8,Static,"Stand so your feet are shoulder width apart and your hands are on your hips.
Twist at your waist until you feel a stretch. Hold for 10 to 15 seconds, then twist to the other side."
Pyramid,1.0,Static,"Start off by rolling your torso forward onto the ball so your hips rest on top of the ball and become the highest point of your body.
Rest your hands and feet on the floor. Your arms and legs can be slightly bent or straight, depending on the size of the ball, your flexibility, and the length of your limbs. This also helps develop stabilizing strength in your torso and shoulders."
