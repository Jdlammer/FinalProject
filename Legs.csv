Leg-up Hamstring Stretch,7.8,Dynamic: Push,"Lie flat on your back, bend one knee, and put that foot flat on the floor to stabilize your spine.
Extend the other leg in the air. If you're tight, you wont be able to straighten it. That's okay. Extend the knee so that the sole of the lifted foot faces the ceiling (or as close as you can get it).
Slowly straighten the legs as much as possible and then pull the leg toward your nose. Switch sides."
Standing Hamstring and Calf Stretch,6.7,Static,"Being by looping a belt, band, or rope around one foot. While standing, place that foot forward.

Standing Toe Touches,6.7,Static,"Stand with some space in front and behind you.

Quad Stretch,4.9,Static,"Lay on your side. Loop a belt, rope, or band around your top foot. Flex the knee and extend your hip, attempting to touch your glutes with your foot, and holding the belt with your hands. This will be your starting position.

Frog Hops,3.9,Dynamic: Push,"Stand with your hands behind your head, and squat down keeping your torso upright and your head up. This will be your starting position.

Lying Glute,3.0,Static,"Lie on your back with your partner kneeling beside you.
Flex the hip of one leg, raising it off of the floor. Rotate the leg so the foot is over the opposite hip, the lower leg perpendicular to your body. Your partner should hold the knee and ankle in place. This will be your starting position.
Attempt to push your leg towards your partner, who should be preventing any actual movement of the leg.
After 10-20 seconds, completely relax as your partner gently pushes the ankle and knee towards your chest. Be sure to inform your helper when the stretch is adequate to prevent injury or overstretching."
